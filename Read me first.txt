This repository gives information and sketches for the direct programming of SAMD21 registers, 
as well as a simple library and sketch examples as follows.

* DIRECT PROGRAMMING OF SAMD21 REGISTERS PDF - Gives detailed instructions on the operation 
and programming of the SAMD21 as applied to Arduino ZERO.

* SAMD21 Blocks PDF - Blocks diagram to follow the descriptive text above.

* PPWM TOOL .xls Excel file as a quick design aid for parameter selection.

All above provides the necessary info & background on the library described below.

=================================================

Lib.Freq_20 provides the library .h and .cpp files.

Example sketch_FREQ._2_a generates a variable Frequency/Duty Cycle PWM on output pin 7
by inserting two parameters. Example sketch_FREQ_3_a generates a variable Frequency PWM 
whose Duty Cyvcle follows the voltage on input pin A5.
